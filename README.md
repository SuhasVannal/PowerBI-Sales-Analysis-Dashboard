## 📌 Project Title

# 📊 Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project delivers an **interactive Sales Performance Analysis dashboard** built using **Power BI** to help stakeholders monitor, analyze, and compare sales performance across **multiple years (2021–2024)**, regions, countries, business segments, customers, and transaction sizes.

The dashboard transforms raw sales data into **actionable business insights** by leveraging advanced **DAX calculations, time-intelligence metrics, and interactive visualizations**, enabling leadership teams to make informed, data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

* Centralize sales data into a **single source of truth**
* Track **overall sales performance and key KPIs**
* Analyze **YoY, MoM, and period-based growth trends**
* Identify **top-performing regions, segments, and customers**
* Enable **self-service analytics** through interactive dashboards

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools

### Tools & Technologies

* Power BI Desktop
* Power Query
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

### Techniques Used

* Data cleaning, transformation, and modeling using Power Query
* Creation of calculated measures for:

  * Total Sales, Average Sales, Total Transactions
  * Year-over-Year (YoY %) using DAX variables
  * Month-over-Month (MoM %) growth
  * Same Period Last Year (SPLY) comparison
  * YTD, MTD, QTD, Last 6 Months, and Last Quarter Sales
* Implementation of DAX time-intelligence functions
* Interactive slicers for Year, Region, Country, Category, Model, Segment, and Color
* Multi-page dashboard design for summary, comparison, and trend analysis

## ⭐ Project Highlights 

### **Problem Statement**

Sales data was distributed across multiple dimensions without a centralized analytics solution. Business users lacked visibility into **sales trends, growth patterns, regional performance, customer contribution, and profitability**, making it difficult to track performance and identify opportunities or risks.

### **Goal of this Project**

Design and deliver a **comprehensive sales analytics dashboard** that consolidates multi-year data and enables:

* KPI monitoring
* Trend and growth analysis
* Comparative performance evaluation
* Business segment and regional contribution analysis

### **Steps Performed**

* Transformed and structured sales data using Power Query to ensure accuracy and consistency
* Built an optimized data model supporting analysis by time, geography, product, and customer
* Developed advanced DAX measures for sales, growth, and comparison metrics
* Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with:

  * Executive KPI cards (Total Sales, Transactions, Customers, Models, Average Sales)
  * YoY, MoM, and SPLY comparisons
  * Sales contribution by Region, Country, and Business Segment
  * Transaction value grouping (Above vs Below 5K)
  * Time-based metrics (YTD, MTD, QTD, Last 6 Months, Last Quarter)
* Implemented slicers and filters for dynamic, self-service exploration

### **Outcome Results**

* Delivered a **single, scalable, and interactive sales analytics solution**
* Enabled stakeholders to quickly identify **top-performing regions and segments**, with clear visibility into revenue drivers
* Highlighted **growth trends, performance declines, and seasonal patterns** through time-based analysis
* Reduced dependency on static reports and manual analysis
* Improved **decision-making speed and accuracy** through real-time, interactive insights

## 📈 Key Business Insights

* Consolidated **141M+ total sales** across multiple years
* Identified dominant revenue contribution from **specific regions and business segments**
* Enabled proactive analysis of declining and growing periods using YoY and MoM metrics
* Provided transaction-level insights to understand high- and low-value sales behavior

## 🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates strong expertise in **Power BI, DAX, data modeling, and business analytics** by transforming raw sales data into a meaningful, decision-ready dashboard. The solution is designed to be **scalable, reusable, and business-friendly**, making it suitable for executive reporting and continuous performance monitoring.
